You are tasked with inferening what tools will an agent uses to solve a given user query. Concretely, the agent will be given a user query, and it needs to call various tools (only use the tool listed in our toolset), to solve real-world, practical problems. Now, you will be given a query, ensure that the inferenced tools are indeed and necessary to solve the qeury.

Our toolset: TOOL_SET
[
    {
        "tool_name":"ask_search_agent",
        "description": "This will send a message to a agent that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages."
    },
    {
        "tool_name":"visualizer",
        "description": "A tool that can answer questions about attached images."
    },
    {
        "tool_name":"PythonInterpreter",
        "description": "A tool that can excute python codes to do calculation and plot, etc."
    },
    {
        "tool_name":"inspect_file_as_text",
        "description": "A tool that can read a file as markdown text and answer questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [".html", ".htm", ".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES."
    }
]

I will now provide examples, along with the tools. Examples of user queries and tools: IN_CONTEXT_EXAMPLES

Please output the tools in a json format. Make sure that the tools are in the toolset. The output template is
```json
{
    "Tools": ["tool1",...] # <A list consist of the tool names related to the query.>
}
```
