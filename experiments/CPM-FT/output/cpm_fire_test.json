This integral represents the area between the curve and the x-axis in the given interval.\n\nUsing a calculator or software for integration, the result is approximately:\n0.78\n\nThus, the size of the shaded area under the curve is 0.78 square units."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design. Which of the following could Cooper's test show?\nChoices:\n(A) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design\n(B) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area\n(C) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road",

Solving for 's', we get s = 3.\n\nNow, in rectangle ABCD, the two squares occupy half of the sides of the rectangle. Therefore, the length and width of the rectangle are twice the side length of the squares, which means AB = 2s = 6 and CD = 2s = 6.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(AB + BC), where BC is the remaining side of the rectangle. In this case, BC = AD = 2s = 6.\n\nThus, the perimeter of ABCD is P = 2(6 + 6) = 2(12) = 24.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of ABCD is 24 units."

        "groundtruth": "25",
        "image_path": "data/FIRE-test/mathvista/images/489.jpg",
        "answer": "To find the length of CD, we can use the fact that trapezoids have parallel sides. Since AB is parallel to BC, and AD is parallel to BC, we can use the similarity of triangles ABD and CDB to find the ratio of corresponding sides.\n\nFrom the given information:\nAB = 24\nAD = 23\nBC = 16\n\nThe ratio of AB to BC is 24/16 = 3/2. Therefore, the ratio of AD to BD (the segment from B to D) should also be 3/2.\n\nLet's denote BD as x. Then, AD/BD = 23/x = 3/2.\n\nCross-multiplying gives us 2 * 23 = 3x, which simplifies to 46 = 3x. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 46/3 ≈ 15.33.\n\nNow, we know that BC + CD = BD + AD. Substituting the values, we get 16 + CD = 15.33 + 23.\n\nSolving for CD, we get CD = 15.33 + 23 - 16 = 22.33.\n\nTherefore, the length of segment CD is approximately 22.33 units."
